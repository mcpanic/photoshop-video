Many foreigners visit Korea and  try this delicious dish and love it. It not only has good flavor, but the way of eating this food is unique. We usually grill bulgogi on the table while we are eating a meal in a restaurant. Wrap bulgogi with lettuce and add soybean paste, garlic, onion, carrot, or cucumber depending on your taste. If you have a chance to visit Korea, I recommend you to try bulgogi. If you don't? Then, try my recipe at home. hehe *^^*\n\nSongs for this Video:\nArtist: \uc96c\uc5bc\ub9ac (Jewelry)\nTitle: 1. \ub2c8\uac00 \ucc38 \uc88b\uc544    /   2.\ubaa8\ub97c\uae4c\ubd10\uc11c", "format": "34 - 360x640", "url": "http://r6---sn-o097zne6.c.youtube.com/videoplayback?source=youtube&ip=2600%3A3c01%3A%3Af03c%3A91ff%3Afedf%3A2d11&itag=34&key=yt1&burst=40&sparams=algorithm%2Cburst%2Ccp%2Cfactor%2Cid%2Cip%2Cipbits%2Citag%2Csource%2Cupn%2Cexpire&ipbits=48&upn=oz-Gtvoo1nw&expire=1369127326&cp=U0hVTlFNVV9HUENONV9JR1lEOlFHR3NfdGUzdDlL&fexp=931306%2C907065%2C906083%2C904824%2C914042%2C916613%2C913809%2C924605%2C901208%2C929123%2C929915%2C929906%2C925714%2C929119%2C931202%2C932802%2C928017%2C912518%2C911416%2C906906%2C904476%2C930807%2C919373%2C906836%2C933701%2C900345%2C926403%2C912711%2C929606%2C910075%2C906098&ms=au&mt=1369104923&factor=1.25&sver=3&id=1ad5446ac1b11a93&algorithm=throttle-factor&mv=m&newshard=yes&signature=2EA9E1F0137E6AB2C482B052505093C90D4FE53A.4CD54312908BCE0EC76C63F4F9A24FD4044104D9&ratebypass=yes", "title": "Korean Food: Bulgogi (Korean BBQ) (\ubd88\uace0\uae30)", "id": "GtVEasGxGpM", "thumbnail": "https://i4.ytimg.com/vi/GtVEasGxGpM/default.jpg", "ext": "flv", "stitle": "Korean Food: Bulgogi (Korean BBQ) (\ubd88\uace0\uae30)", "extractor": "youtube", "uploader": "aeriskitchen", "duration": "316", "fulltitle": "Korean Food: Bulgogi (Korean BBQ) (\ubd88\uace0\uae30)", "player_url": null, "uploader_id": "aeriskitchen", "subtitles": null, "playlist_index": null}
